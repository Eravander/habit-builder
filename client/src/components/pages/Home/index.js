                            If you're motivated by seeing results, we recommend you use the 21 days method. 
                            This breaks down your progress in to 21 day cycles, preventing scattered missed days from seeming as damaging.
                            If you miss a day, finish your current cycle and start with a clean slate. This is a useful technique to keep your focus on the positive.
